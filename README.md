# PHP_Auto_ClassLoader

Welcome to the PHP Auto ClassLoader repository! This project aims to simplify and streamline the process of autoloading PHP classes in your projects. Instead of manually requiring each class file, you can use this autoloader to automatically load classes on demand, saving you time and effort.

# Features:

Effortless Autoloading: With the PHP Auto ClassLoader, you don't need to manually include or require each class file in your codebase. The autoloader takes care of this for you, dynamically loading classes as they are needed.

Namespace Support: This autoloader is designed to work with PHP namespaces, allowing you to organize your classes in a structured manner and autoload them accordingly.

Customizable: The autoloader is designed to be customizable to fit your project's needs. You can configure the autoloading rules to match your file structure and naming conventions.

Easy Integration: The repository provides clear instructions on how to integrate the autoloader into your project. You'll be up and running in no time.

# Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local environment.
Include the AutoClassLoader.php file in your project.
Configure the autoloader by specifying your project's namespace and the corresponding base directory.
Start using your classes without worrying about manual includes or requires.
Example:

php
Copy code
// Include the autoloader
require_once 'path/to/AutoClassLoader.php';

// Configure the autoloader with your namespace and base directory
AutoClassLoader::register('Your\\Namespace', 'path/to/your/directory');

// Now you can create instances of your classes without manual includes
$example = new Your\Namespace\ExampleClass();
$anotherExample = new Your\Namespace\AnotherClass();
